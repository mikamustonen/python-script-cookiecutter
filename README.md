# Cookiecutter for simple Dockerized Python scripts

This cookiecutter template allows you to create a starting point similar to
[this](https://github.com/mikamustonen/dockerized-python-example) for a Python
script where the dependencies are Dockerized and the image is rebuilt only as
needed.

Assuming that you have installed [`cookiecutter`](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/),
you can simply run
```bash
cookiecutter gh:mikamustonen/python-script-cookiecutter
```
and follow the prompts.
